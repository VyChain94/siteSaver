## This Extension

At theGarden we are interested in everything software development-related: from prototyping to implementation and maintenance. Our goal is to use software for the cultivation and optimization of useful, valuable, and enjoyable products. It is our privilege to offer a chance to be seen on the web to small businesses and individuals alike. Whether that be creating a website for you from the ground up, or providing a place for interested parties to find and learn about what you offer is what we offer.
